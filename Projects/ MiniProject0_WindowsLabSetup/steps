# 🧱 Mini Project 0 – Windows 10 Lab Setup (VirtualBox)

### 🎯 Objective
Set up a Windows 10 Pro virtual environment using Oracle VirtualBox to support future IT troubleshooting and cybersecurity labs (e.g., P1–P8).

---

## ⚙️ Step-by-Step Setup

### 🪟 Step 1 – Install Windows 10 (Base System)
- Created new VM: `ITSupport-Cybersecurity-Lab-Project`
- Allocated 4GB RAM, 2 CPUs, and 50GB virtual disk.
- Installed Windows 10 Pro (64-bit) using official Microsoft ISO.
- Configured basic settings, privacy options, and created a local account (`IceLab`).

### 💽 Step 2 – Install VirtualBox Guest Additions
- Inserted Guest Additions CD:  
  `Devices → Insert Guest Additions CD Image...`
- Ran `VBoxWindowsAdditions-amd64.exe` inside VM.
- Restarted VM to enable:
  - Fullscreen display
  - Seamless mouse integration
  - Drag-and-drop capability

### 🌐 Step 3 – Configure Bridged Network
- Switched VM network mode from `NAT` → `Bridged Adapter`.
- Selected adapter: **Intel(R) Wi-Fi 6 AX200 160MHz**
- Verified connectivity using:
  ```bash
  ping google.com

 ---

 
### 📁 Step 4 – Set Up Shared Folder
- Created shared folder on host:
- Added to VirtualBox via:  
**Settings → Shared Folders → Add Folder**
- Folder Name: `Project IT_Cybersecurity`
- Options: ✅ Auto-mount, ✅ Make Permanent
- Enabled “Network Discovery and File Sharing” in Windows.
- Verified path:  D:\Project IT_Cybersecurity

---

### 💾 Step 5 – Create Snapshot (Baseline)
- Saved baseline state using: **Machine → Take Snapshot**
- Named snapshot: ``` Clean_State_Before_P1 ```
- Description: ``` Baseline setup: Windows 10 Pro + Guest Additions + Bridged Network + Shared Folder. ```
📸 **Screenshot:** `05_Snapshot_Created.png`
✅ *Snapshot successfully created for system restore before each project.* --- ###

--- ## 🧠 Reflection This mini project served as the foundation for my cybersecurity and IT support environment. I learned to configure VirtualBox efficiently, manage snapshots, and ensure seamless file and network integration between host and guest systems. This environment will be used to simulate real-world troubleshooting cases in upcoming projects (P1–P8). --- ##
